                        Manual therapy in a broad sense includes all therapeutic techniques which are performed manually (joint mobilisation, manual therapy of the soft tissue, lymphatic drainage therapy), while in the narrow sense, manual therapy is a physiotherapeutic concept, which includes diagnostics and treatment of neuromuscular dysfunctions and dysfunctions of the spine and limbs. It deals with the structural changes of the locomotor system, which cause pain and functional disorders.

                        Therapeutic Massage is a combination of Relaxation Massage and Remedial Massage to not only relax your whole body but at the same time, work through some of the muscle issues or “tight spots” you may be experiencing.

                        Electrotherapy is the use of electrical energy as a medical treatment.[1] In medicine, the term electrotherapy can apply to a variety of treatments, including the use of electrical devices such as deep brain stimulators for neurological disease. The term has also been applied specifically to the use of electric current to speed wound healing. Additionally, the term "electrotherapy" or "electromagnetic therapy" has also been applied to a range of alternative medical devices and treatments.

                        Biodex Isokinetic testing machines are used to measure muscle strength and identify potentially harmful weaknesses.
                        By isolating the muscle groups and testing how much they can handle, therapists and personal trainers can identify where you are weakest and what movements might be contributing to that sore back or shoulder.
                        The machine’s main function is to improve your function. All of the different factors that can effect your movement can be measured and replicated exactly with the machine.

                        GRAVITY, a cash-based wellness program utilising Total Gym equipment, provides therapists with the ability to seamlessly transition short-term rehab patients into long-term fitness clients and vice-versa. Pilates and strength training can be seamlessly integrated.
                        Getting a client fully fit after injury can be a challenge. Training methods have to be fully customised to suit client/patient needs, building conditioning and fitness while respecting the integrity of the injured body part. GRAVITY’s Post Rehab programming on Total Gym equipment offers rehabilitation and wellness clinics a flexible solution with adaptive training paradigms and multiple applications.

                        Mechanotransduction is the physiological process where cells sense and respond to mechanical loads. This paper reclaims the term “mechanotherapy” and presents the current scientific knowledge underpinning how load may be used therapeutically to stimulate tissue repair and remodelling in tendon, muscle, cartilage and bone.
