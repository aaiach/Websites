                    Established on 12 August 1970 after a merger between Stade Saint-Germain and Paris FC, Paris Saint-Germain Football Club have always represented both Paris and nearby Saint-Germain-en-Laye. And with so many people eager to see a big club wearing the capital’s colours once again, the nascent team grew at a stunning pace early on. Top-tier status was attained within four years and by the end  of the 1970s, “Les Rouge-et-Bleu” were ready to embark upon a historic decade. PSG tasted French Cup honours in 1982 and 1983, before capturing their first league crown in 1986 – breakthroughs that opened the doors to Europe and some memorable encounters, particularly with Juventus. As significant as those successes were, however, the 1990s proved even more fruitful, with Paris Saint-Germain entering a golden age after television giants Canal+ bought the club in May 1991. Now enjoying serious investment, the capital outfit were able to set their sights steadily higher. PSG were on the move and between 1992 and 1998 they contested two UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup finals – winning in 1996 – reached the UEFA Champions League semifinals once and twice advanced to the same stage of the UEFA Cup. On the domestic scene, results were just as satisfying, with PSG celebrating another League title, three French Cups, two League Cups and just as many Champions Trophy wins.
